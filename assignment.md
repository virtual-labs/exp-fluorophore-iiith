#### Pre-Experiment

- In fluorescence, generally the state from which the system decays is independent of the excitation wavelength. Why?
- What happen to the energy of the excited state and the emission spectrum when re-organization of solvent dipoles occurs around the excited fluorophore?
- Compare the effects of increase in refractive index and dielectric constant on the ground and excited state energies.
- The Lippert-Mataga equation tends to give greater than the predicted Stokes shifts for protic solvents like water and alcohols. Why?
- When the solvent has no permanent dipole moment, how n is related to &#949; and what is the value of &#955;f?

#### Post-Experiment

- How many grams of curcumin should one dissolve in a given solvent to prepare a 100 mL 1x10-3M stock solution?
- In Lippert-Mataga plots, groups of solvents with similar chemical nature often tend to cluster. Why?
- If one obtains a positive slope in the Lippert-Mataga plot, is the excited state more polar or less polar than the ground state?
- In the Lippert-Mataga plot, does the point corresponding to methanol lie above or below the straight line fit? What could be the possible reason for this?
- What do the steady state spectral measurements of curcumin suggest about the polarity of the S1 state with respect to its S0 ground state?
